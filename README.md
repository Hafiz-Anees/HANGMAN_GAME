# HANGMAN_GAME
Experience the classic word-guessing game, Hangman, implemented using Python's simple random module, loops, and if-else statements. In this game, players attempt to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. With each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman figure is drawn.
